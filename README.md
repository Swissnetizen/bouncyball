# bouncyball
This game is based on the interesting mechanic of having the player constantly bouncing up and down, with the only controls being horizontal.
With these controls the player is left to navigate platformer levels full of hazards.
Another interesting design choice was allowing collisions off coins, enabling more creative platforming with the limited control set.
